# Superstore_Performance

This is a repository exploring the sales performance for "superstores". I found this dataset on Kaggle and descided to investigate it and see what I could come up with. I cleaned the data, found some quick performance metrics to present, formatted it in SQL to work on it and investigated it further. Additionally, I visualized the information through Tableau Public.
